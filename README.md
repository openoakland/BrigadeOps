# Welcome to BrigadeOps

This repository is used to manage Brigade Operations projects for OpenOakland, a volunteer collective that bridges community and technology for a thriving and equitable Oakland. It's a work-in-progress, so if you have ideas for how it should be used, submit an issue.

## Contributing
All contributors are expected to adhere to OpenOakland's [Code of Conduct](https://openoakland.org/code-of-conduct/). This emphasizes a collaborative, participatory approach to project development. We're here to support each other as a community and we take this CoC seriously. We appreciate your understanding and shared commitment.

### I have a question about how OpenOakland works.
1. Start by checking on https://openoakland.org for the answer to your question.
2. If you can't find what you're looking for, you can submit a Question issue (to be created).
3. If you need further help or want to reach someone directly, email steering@openoakland.org.

### I have an idea about how OpenOakland could work better.
_This workflow requires the implementation of labels and Issue templates, then the removal of this note._

1. Start by checking issues labelled `Suggestions` to see if a similar suggestion has been added.
2. If a similar or related suggestion exists, please add a comment on that issue. We can also create a new one if your suggestion needs to be its own thing.
3. If you don't see a similar or related suggestion, submit a Suggestion issue.
4. Since our brigade believes in leaning into action, we encourage you to collaborate with others to build buy-in for your suggestion and shape it collectively. Try joining us at an [upcoming Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/events/) to share your idea and request input/collaborators.

### I want to know what BrigadeOps projects OpenOakland is working on.
_This workflow requires the implementation of Project boards, then the removal of this note._

- See our full [to-do list](https://github.com/openoakland/BrigadeOps/labels/to%20do). These issues are all organized into various Project boards for status tracking.
- An easier view is to explore the current [Project boards](https://github.com/openoakland/BrigadeOps/projects).

### I'd like to work on an existing BrigadeOps project
